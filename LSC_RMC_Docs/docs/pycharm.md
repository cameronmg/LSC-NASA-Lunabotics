# PyCharm Notes

## Installation

After installing [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), enable the Toolbar and 
Tool Buttons by clicking on `View-->Toolbar` and `View-->Tool Buttons`.

## Adjusting the PyCharm Interpreter Path 

The `PYTHONPATH` shell variable is used to modify the interpreter path in the shell.

To modify the interpreter path in PyCharm:

1. Open the Preferences panel 

2. Double click on `Project:your-project-name`

3. Select the `Project Interpreter`  

4. Click on icon to the right of the "Project Interpreter" value

5. Click on `More...`
 
6. Select the interpreter you are using 

7. Click on the tree symbol 
<img title="Show paths for the selected interpreter" src="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2016.3/icon_show_paths.png" width="21" height="19">
at the bottom of the dialog (hovering over the symbol reveals "Show paths for the selected interpreter")

8. Click on the "plus" symbol 
<img title="Add âŒ˜N" src="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2016.3/new.png" width="12" height="12">
and add your package

Any change you make to the interpreter path will be seen by all your PyCharm projects, so you do not
have to go through this process multiple times.
