# Metro Mini Notes

A Metro Mini can be purchased [here](https://www.adafruit.com/products/2590).

Windows and OSX drivers required to communicate with a Metro Mini via USB are 
[here](http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm)  and 
[here](http://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers).

When using a Metro Mini with the Arduino IDE, use the Arduino/Genuino Uno board setting.

The Metro Mini is powered by an Atmega328 - same as the UNO. So the i2c bus is the same also: 
SDA is A4 and SCL is A5.
