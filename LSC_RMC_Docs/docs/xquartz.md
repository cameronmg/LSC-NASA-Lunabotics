# XQuartz Notes

`XQuartz` is an X server for OSX.

## Usage
Download and run XQuartz from [here](https://www.xquartz.org).

Type `xhost +` in the xterm that is created when you start XQuartz.

Login to the target machine with: `ssh -Y machine_name`

You can now run a gui app on the unix host and it will be displayed 
on your Mac.
